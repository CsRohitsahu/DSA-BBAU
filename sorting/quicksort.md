# Partition Algorithm  
 -> Chose pivot & we put it at its right position(pivot index)
 -> we rearrange elements before & after pivot index such that  element less than pivot left to pivot and greater than pivot right of pivot 


# it is based on divide and conquer approach  

# time complexity 
 worst case ->O(n^2)
 average case -> 0(nlogn)
 best case -> omega(nlogn)
# space complexity 
 O(logn) 

#  quick sort is not stable algorithm
