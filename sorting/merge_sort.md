step 1-> Divide the array into 2 equal halves
step 2-> sort the 2 subarray seprately using   recursion  (sub prblem)
step 3-> merge the 2 sorted subarrays to create  an overall sorted array(self work)

# it is based on divide and conquer approach  

# time complexity 
 worst case ->O(nlogn)
 average case -> 0(nlogn)
 best case -> omega(nlogn)
# space complexity 
 O(n) 

#  merge sort is stable algorithm
